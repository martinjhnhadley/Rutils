# Rutils

Collection of R functions that I've used throughout the years. 

This includes the following functions:

<ul>
  <li>load_utils.R: The primary function for loading all functions. Sets to default directory (github/Rutils)</li>
  <li>clearR.R: clear series - includes clear.console (wipes the console down) and clear.environment (removes all non-functions)</li>
  <li> conversion_script.R: useful conversion functions</li>
</ul>
